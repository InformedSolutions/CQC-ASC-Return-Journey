					<p>Previous answer:</p>
					<p>A nutritional assessment is completed on initial admission alongside the MUST screening tool, information gathered include weight/BMI, personal preferences, likes/dislikes,
						specialist dietary requirements, known allergies. Observation will include do clothes look loose/are rings to big? Disease and physical disability will be considered,
						weight loss, fragile skin, wound healing, apathy, taste sensation, impaired swallowing, bowel habits, assistance, special diet, history of referrals. Once the information
						is gathered a person centred care plan will be devised, this could include the views of the resident/family/advocate/professionals depending on the resident.
						Active interventions include monitoring of intake, completing a diet notification and referral to appropriate health professionals.
						The menus follow the guidelines/requirements for a healthy diet, additional risk assessments are implemented and training from external agencies has been implemented around diet,
						swallowing/weight management.</p>
